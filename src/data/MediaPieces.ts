As the mechanical rhythm of the machinery fighting to keep him alive ticks away almost unnoticed in the background, she has a series of flashbacks of their life together, and the events that lead to this moment.

Finally, the lush counterpoint in the string section near the end adds context and a moment of repose when the danger has been averted.",

While she was away he took it upon himself to redecorate in an awe-inspiring display of mischief combined with a wanton disregard for principles of interior design.

It seems that it has been some time since life as we know it existed here. as the camera pans up and we can see the whole city not a person can be found amongst the rubble.

In a quiet park two people long estranged finally come to an understanding and begin to knit their broken lives and relationship together. as the music continues to swell to greater and greater heights the release of years of sadness, longing and finally forgiveness becomes overwhelming. They finally understand and are understood.",

The use of strings, harp, harmonics, and some subtle synth sounds add a feel of scope and scale",
